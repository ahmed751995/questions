  /theorem: at least n initially infected students in n x n grid in order 
            to be completely infected/
  #+END_QUOTE

  proof: by using induction, let P(n) be the theorom,

  *Base Case*: P(1) is true, since there is one square and one student so the
               grid is full

  *Inductive step*: assume P(n) is true,

  at n + 1 grid if we have n initially infected students we have two cases

  *case 1*: n students not in n x n part of n + 1 grid so n x n will not get fully
            infected, hence n + 1 won't be completely infected.

  *case 2* n students in n x n part of n + 1 grid, the n x n part will be 
           completely infected but that leaves one row and one column not 
           infected yet so we need at least one more infected student to 
           be completely infected.
   
  hence *case 1* and *case 2* prove P(n + 1).

  so it follows by induction that P(n) is true for all n | n >= 1. *Q.E.D*
